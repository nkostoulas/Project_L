It’s no simple homage, however. There’s clearly plenty of imagination in the kitchen, and the veg-heavy menu features some genuinely inspired dishes. Even a simple green chopped salad is noteworthy. Jar Kitchen hits the mark when it moves toward fish and meat, too – try the garam masala pulled pork sandwich spiked with kaffir lime and oozing with curry mayo and raita, or the likes of grilled king prawns rubbed with rose harissa and coriander. Sure, it might go a little, erm, nuts with nuts and seeds, but this Drury Lane spot is leading the way in modern café dining.",

But at this Swiss Cottage stalwart you can feast not only on Malaysian dishes, but on specialities from the the Singapore Straits – an island melting-pot whose majority Chinese population and shared history (and border) with Malaysia makes for some very interesting happenings on your plate. Skip the everyday Cantonese stuff in favour of Straits classics: mouthwatering sambals, curries and noodles. It’s hawker-style food, but –as a concession to England’s less-than-tropical climate – served in a stylish, restaurant setting, tablecloths and all.",

At Baiwei, ‘100 flavours’ translates as ‘100 ways to dazzle your taste buds’. Extra bonus: uncommonly friendly service.",

Head chef Tom Ryalls deals in gutsy platefuls of seasonal ingredients, but his light touch lifts the likes of cod with fresh peas, lentils and bacon, or whole Portland crab with chips and mayonnaise to another realm. Cocktails on the terrace – which is heated and covered when necessary – are a must.",

One signature dish, beef from ten-to-12-year-old Galician milking cows (chargrilled and served with cheese-stuffed potatoes and blackened onion), costs £88 for two. Happily, other dishes are equally good and easier on the wallet. The basement dining room is intimate and atmospheric; the street-level wine bar best on a sunny day (as are the two alfresco tables overlooking so-picturesque-it-should-be-in-a-Richard-Curtis-movie Shepherd Market). Putting your meal together from small plates is the best way to leave without having spent a fortune.",

They’ve hired a pro to run the kitchen (Elizabeth Allen, formerly of Islington’s excellent Smokehouse), and the food, which costs £40 for four courses (and includes bread with ‘burnt’ butter, gooey chocolate truffles and a shot of ‘Pidgincello’ at the end), is terrific.",

Social Eating House’s dark, low-slung dining room, with its mirrored ceiling and modern artworks, feels cool and informal, while chef Paul Hood’s menu delivers dishes that are at once highly sophisticated, accessible and above all delicious – often throwing in a welcome touch of theatricality when you least expect it. Efficient, attentive staff keep this star-studded show on the road.",

      "description": "What with its smokehouse moniker and custom-made charcoal grill, you might expect Rok to be all about meat. Sure, it’s fantastic – brined and cured, Nordic style, then cooked sous-vide before being pulled over the coals – but ignore the rest of the menu at your peril, because the kitchen team has somehow ensured that every dish, from the solitary scallop to sides you can’t stop eating, is a talking point. Rok’s narrow dining room is beautifully designed in that cosy yet unvarnished way typical of Scandinavia, and clued-up staff are simply charming. Our tip? Arrive a bit early and sink a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar – they’re so yummy you’ll probably return for a nightcap.",

      "description": "Forget Narnia. This is a wardrobe you really want to enter, but then stay in. Okay, Bao isn’t actually a wardrobe; but the interior of the dinky Soho eatery feels so much like being inside a giant wood-veneered Ikea creation, you can almost hear the couples debating whether they really need 350 tea lights. But looks aside, Bao is a truly exceptional place. It serves award-winning Taiwanese street food with plenty of kick (it started life as a tiny Netil Market stall before grabbing the attention – and financial backing – of Trishna’s deep-pocketed co-founder Karam Sethi; a second site in Fitzrovia has since opened to attempt to sate demand for those pillowy buns). It’s the kind of stuff that’s great if you’re a little bit drunk. Just not paralytic – it’s too good to be wasted on the wasted.",

      "description": "There was a flurry of Peruvian openings in London in 2012, but Ceviche – which has since spawned an Old Street offshoot – was the Machu Picchu, towering over several peaks. Showcasing the eponymous dish of citrus-cured fish spiked with chilli, the place serves half a dozen versions of ceviche. But the kitchen knows a lot more than just how to skin and slice a fish – there are also excellent chargrilled meat and fish skewers (anticuchos), crumbly corn cakes and other nibbles on offer. Be sure to sample a pisco sour or two at the bar while you’re there.",

      "description": "There’s nothing like Hoppers in London. Sure, there’s good Sri Lankan food in certain pockets of the capital. But very few restaurants are exclusively Sri Lankan (most are South Indian and certainly don’t do hoppers, the egg-topped pancakes after which this Soho restaurant is named); the few exceptions are okay, rather than amazing. So the fact that Hoppers is outrageously good is even more impressive. The small room, a sexy Soho take on all things Sri Lankan, is always full and always buzzing (and yes, you’ll almost certainly have to queue), but it’s more than worth the wait. If small plates, full flavours and unapologetic spicing are your bag, Hoppers will get your pulse – and your tastebuds – racing.",

At last, everyone who’d ever wanted to sample the fiery Thai street food menu could do so in a stylish and exotic former garment factory walking distance from Liverpool Street (or Aldgate) tube. And sample it you should. Despite the cooking being from two non-Thais (ex-masterchef winner Andy Oliver is a Brit, Mark Dobbie is Aussie), the authenticity of spicing of some dishes is as straight-from-the-hills-of-northern-Thailand as they come. If your palate is naturally timid, go anyway, just ask the friendly staff to guide you.",

      "description": "It’s not possible to have a bad time at The Barbary. Sure, you’ll probably have to queue, but even that’s tolerable, because then you get to feast on moreish deep-fried snacks (like the Moroccan cigars) that don’t appear on the main menu. If the queue is huge and spills out and over the door sill, then you get to hang out in Neal’s Yard, one of London’s loveliest hidden courtyards. The food is ‘modern Israeli’, though in truth, it’s anything but. What they’ve done is taken the ancient recipes from across north Africa (from the one-time Barbary coast) and the Middle East that have gone on to influence food in today’s Israeli kitchen, then reimagined them for 2016. The smoky room is stuffed full of music, laughter and people that are beautiful in the best way: inside and out.",

This tiny spin-off of Clapham’s acclaimed Dairy isn’t known as it’s ‘naughty little sister’ for nothing. The music is grungy, the staff a charming mix of achingly hip and infectiously enthusiastic, but it’s the cooking (contemporary European, but with ingredients borrowed from every corner of the globe) that really breaks the rules. Plates are small but deeply intricate, yet somehow without ever crossing the line into fru-fru or fussy. It’s casual, creative and cool.",

      "description": "The first Barrafina, on Frith Street, was the original small-plates-and-no-reservations counter bar pioneer, a template that has since gone viral. This bustling, Barcelona-style tapas joint was so adored that owners the Hart brothers were under pressure to pull something really special out of the bag when they announced a follow-up site in Covent Garden (it’s since been joined by a third branch, on Drury Lane). They didn’t let Londoners down: Adelaide Street is a slightly glitzier, slightly larger venue that pays homage to its Frith Street sibling without being a straight copycat. So there’s the same striped marble bar overlooking the kitchen, but its curved design cleverly allows for a couple more grateful bums on those burgundy leather stools. There’s a menu that includes the tapas holy trinity of tortilla, croquetas and jamón, plus Barrafina’s signature market-fresh seafood, but which also runs to Josper-grilled meats, offal delicacies such as deep-fried lamb’s brain, and Mallorcan specialities. And there’s the same buzz around getting a table, but there’s also a swish private dining room in the basement for those with more cash than patience. In short, it rocks. What are you waiting for? Get in line!",
